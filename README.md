# Digital_Signal_Processing_Project1
The first part of the project is about generation and Fourie analysis of telephone touch tones in Python. Specifically, we produce the tones using a formula based on specific frequencies that are commonly used in modern phones.. Afterwards, we continue with some Fourie Analysis and a processing on a tone sequence we created. 

The second part is relevant with Short-Time Fourier Analysis (STFT) applied on given music/voice signals and the graphical representation of their features.

Last but not least, the project refers to biosignal analysis. To be more specific, it deals with signals of whales sounds, which we are process in order to come to a conclusion about the sounds that affect/harm the in-danger species.

The project created as part of the course "Digital Signal Processing" at School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NTUA and the aim of this work is NOT to present it as my personal research but as my approach to the problems assigned. Please refer to the project's prompt (provided in Greek) for detailed descriptions of the three tasks.
