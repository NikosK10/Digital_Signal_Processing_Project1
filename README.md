# DSP-Telephone-Touch-Tones
The first part of the project is about production and Fourie analysis of telephone touch tones in Python. Specifically, we produce the tones with a given formula with specific frequencies that are adjusted in most phones nowadays. Afterwards, we continue with some Fourie Analysis and a processing on a tone sequence we created. 

The second part is relevant with Short Time Fourie Analysis applied on given music/voice signals and the graphical representation of their features.

Last but not least, the project refers to Biosignals' analysis. To be more specific, it deals with signals of whales sounds, which we are process in order to come to a conclusion about the sounds that affect/harm the in-danger species.

The project created as part of the course "Digital Signal Processing" at School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NTUA and the aim of this work is NOT to present it as my own research but as my approach to the problems given. Read the project's prompt in the uploaded file for more details about the 3 tasks (It is given in Greek).
